Graph visuaisations are always limited by the number of nodes, aswell as the number of edges. 
The simple geometrie of Adjacenzy matrxes allows an esimation of those upper limits. May edgtes is always nodes**2.

On a typical sreen with ~25” alows to  about 

table

The most simple
 aproach is zooming, unfortunatly this brings new problems, and doeas not solve

Simple zooming bring problems:
Zoomed in:Invisible edges in hidden zoom area, tasks wie mit allen verbunden geht nimma

Simple zooming dows not solve problems:
Zoomed out: to small cols/rows with unreadable labels

Improvments in a spezific kontext, 
Clustering, recursive clustering: relations beteen nodes, clusters (ham). depends on clustering, this is dataproprocessing from my point of view.

Hybrid: dens clusters (nodetrix) is usefull if dense subclusters a present. Shows them as adjm in traditional graph

algo -> sort,
multible sorts (within cluser, clusters)

minimizes unseed edges. sugest marks for unseedn edges

shows adjm in tratitionsl graph
best for dense clustes in graph
